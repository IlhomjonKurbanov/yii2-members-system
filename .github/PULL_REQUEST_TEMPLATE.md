New Pull Request
----------------

Please fill out the table below, then delete this paragraph. Please create an
issue before creating a pull request. This gives us a good central area to talk
about the pull request. Please link to the issue in the table by simply putting
a hash tag followed by the issue number, ie: `#1234`. Github will automatically
link it to the issue. Also fill out what type of pull request this is. If you
are adding a new feature, it would be an `enhancement`. If you are fixing a few
typos, then `typo`. If you are adding, or changing documentation, then `doc`. Then
provide more details below. Be descriptive and tell us why your PR should be
merged. What does it do, how does it work, why? Does it break anything? Is there 
anything special that needs done before this PR works or relies on?
