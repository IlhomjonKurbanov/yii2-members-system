### My Vision

This project is a base line that I use for client projects that require a
user/admin section. I want this to be my starting point for every project. It
does not need all the bells and whistles, but have the basic needs of every
project. So in order to add something new, it must be needed in majority of new
projects. I will not be adding a feature that only is needed in 1 out of 10
projects. I want this as a middle ground between the yii2 advanced template and
the final project. More than the yii2 advanced template provides, so I don't have
to do anything other than add custom features, theme, etc.

### How To Contribute

Let's walk through an example. You found a bug in the password reset feature.

1. Create a new issue
2. Fork this repo.
3. Clone your instance of the forked repo
4. Create a new branch named `password-reset-bugfix`
5. Make your changes
6. Push your changes to your forked repo
7. Create a pull request and link to your issue. ie: `Password Reset Bugfix #1234`

**PLEASE CREATE A NEW BRANCH** before you do anything! Your work should be done
in this branch! I will not accept PRs on the master branch!

### What To Do

There are a few areas I would like for you to contribute if you want to:

- Expand, cleanup, make faster `Gruntfile.js`
- Fix, perfect, add, cleanup documentation
- Fix current errors/issues
- Finish anything listed as @todo (there are plugins to search a project for @todo tags)
- Write valid Codeception tests

I do not accept chincy hacks! It must be the most Yii way to handle the issue, or
I wont accept it. So be willing to have your code critiqued.

I am not open to dramatically changing the way things are done with this system. You
may create an issue to state your position/idea, but ultimately I have a vision for this
repo and may reject it if it doesn't fit what I am doing.
